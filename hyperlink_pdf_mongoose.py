hyperlink_pdf_v2_chapters.py -- Everything hyperlink_pdf.py does, PLUS:
detects references to this book's own CHAPTER NAMES (e.g. an italicized
"Combat" or "Tactical Combat" appearing in running text, with or
without a page number nearby) and links them to that chapter's actual
starting page.

Chapter names are extracted straight from this book's own Table of
Contents (top-level numbered entries like "11. Combat . . . 362"), not
hardcoded -- so this should adapt to a different GURPS book's own
chapter list automatically.

Matching is deliberately conservative to avoid false positives:
  - Only a CONTIGUOUS italicized run whose text EXACTLY equals a
    chapter title counts as a match -- not a substring. This is what
    keeps "Combat Reflexes" or "Close Combat" from falsely matching
    the "Combat" chapter; the full italic span has to equal "Combat"
    with nothing else italicized alongside it.
  - Reuses the same "GURPS <Title>" cross-book detection as the page-
    number linker -- "GURPS Magic" (a different book) won't get linked
    to this book's own "Magic" chapter.
  - Never creates a link where one already exists (same rule as the
    rest of the pipeline), so a chapter name immediately next to an
    already-linked page reference doesn't get double-linked.

    exactly once, as a one-off page title positioned in the upper part

      (a) an anomalously huge bounding box (>50pt tall) -- confirmed on
          the actual Index-opening page of all 3 books (Core Rulebook
          p.263, High Guard p.289, Companion p.184); looks like MuPDF
          mis-measuring a decorative section-title treatment (same
          anomaly class as bug #15 in CLAUDE.md), but empirically a
          reliable positive signal here rather than noise.
      (b) a normal but clearly larger-than-body-text word (height
          >=17pt -- body text in these books is ~13pt, real headings
          are ~19-21pt) sitting in the top 40% of the page. This is
          what catches Core Rulebook/High Guard's plain 'CONTENTS'
          heading, while excluding an ordinary sentence that happens to
          contain the word ('...dump its contents on one...', ~13pt)
          and a same-sized TOC list entry further down the same page
          ('Index . . . 184', which sits well past the top-40% cutoff).
      (c) the SAME keyword rendered TWICE at byte-identical bounding-box
          coordinates on the page -- a faux-bold/shadow rendering trick
          some books use for a heading instead of a genuinely bigger
          font. Confirmed on Aliens of Charted Space vol. 2: its
          'CONTENTS' heading is only 14.7pt tall (fails check (b)'s
          17pt cutoff outright -- a font-size threshold tuned on one
          set of books doesn't necessarily hold for another from the
          same publisher), but is printed twice at the exact same (x0,
          y0, x1, y1). Ordinary body text is never printed twice at the
          identical pixel position, so this is safe to treat as a
          standalone positive signal without picking a size cutoff at
          all -- it doesn't replace (a)/(b), it catches what they miss.
